## 1. Installation

1. To run the project make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed. It should also install npm as part of the installation process. Latest version is v20.16.0 LTS

2. Once that is done, clone the project using the command `git clone https://github.com/clam1987/Project-Appa.git ` or grab that link and clone the project via the github UI.

3. In the root directory, run the command `npm i or npm install` to install the packages needed to run this app. You can view all packages in the `package.json` file.

## 2. Starting the game

To start the game, all you need to do is run `npm start` in the command line and the app should open a new tab in your browser and start the game.
